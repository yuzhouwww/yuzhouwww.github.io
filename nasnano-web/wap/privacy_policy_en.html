	<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Last Updated: [2018 July 16]</span></p>
	<p class="p3"><span class="s1">This Privacy Policy explains our practices regarding the collection, use and
			disclosure of information that we receive through our Services. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any
			third-party websites, services or applications, even if they are accessible through our Services. Also, please
			note that, unless we define a term in this Privacy Policy, all capitalized terms used in this Privacy Policy have
			the same meanings as in our Terms of Service. So, please make sure that you have read and understand our Terms of
			Service.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
	<p class="p3"><span class="s1">1. Revisions to this Privacy Policy. Any information that is collected via our
			Services is covered by the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is collected. We may revise this
			Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we’ll notify you of
			those changes by posting them on the Services or by sending you an email or other notification, and we’ll update
			the “Last Updated Date” above to indicate when those changes will become effective. You understand and agree that
			you will be deemed to have accepted the updated Privacy Policy if you use the Services after the updated Privacy
			Policy is posted on the Services.</span></p>
	<p class="p3"><span class="s1">2. Information Collected or Received from You. Our primary purposes for the collection
			and processing of information is to provide our Services (to perform our contract with you), to improve our
			Services, to administer your use of the Services, to market the Services to you, and to enable you to enjoy and
			easily navigate our Services. In addition we may process your information where we have a legitimate interest
			(e.g., fraud prevention, network and information security, research (including marketing research), and direct
			marketing), and as you otherwise consent. (a)Information Collected Using Cookies and other Web Technologies.Like
			many online services, we may use automated data collection tools such as Cookies and Web Beacons to collect
			certain information.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
	<p class="p3"><span class="s1">(a) </span><span class="s2">Information Collected Using Cookies and other Web
			Technologies.</span><span class="s1">Like many online services, we may use automated data collection tools such
			as Cookies and Web Beacons to collect certain information.</span></p>
	<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>“Cookies”</b> are small text files that are placed on your device by a web server
			when you access our Services. We may use both session Cookies and persistent Cookies to identify that you’ve
			logged in to the Services and to tell us how and when you interact with our Services. We may also use Cookies to
			monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on our Services and to customize and improve our Services. Unlike
			persistent Cookies, session Cookies are deleted when you log off from the Services and close your browser.
			Although most browsers automatically accept Cookies, you can change your browser options to stop automatically
			accepting Cookies or to prompt you before accepting Cookies. Please note, however, that if you don’t accept
			Cookies, you may not be able to access all portions or features of the Services. Some third-party service
			providers that we engage (including third-party advertisers) may also place their own Cookies on your device.
			This practice is commonly referred to as “interest-based advertising” or “online behavioral advertising.” If you
			would like to opt out of the cookies we employ on the Services, you may do so by blocking, deleting or disabling
			them as your browser or device permits. Note that this Privacy Policy covers only our use of Cookies and does not
			include use of Cookies by such third parties.</span></p>
	<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>“Web Beacons”</b> (also known as web bugs, pixel tags or clear GIFs) are tiny
			graphics with a unique identifier that may be included on our Services for several purposes, including to deliver
			or communicate with Cookies, to track and measure the performance of our Services, to monitor how many visitors
			view our Services, and to monitor the effectiveness of our advertising. Unlike Cookies, which are stored on the
			device, Web Beacons are typically embedded invisibly on web pages (or in an e-mail).</span></p>
	<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>“Log Data”</b> means certain information about how a person uses our Services

			operating system, the web page that a User was visiting before accessing our Services, the pages or features of
			our Services to which a User browsed and the time spent on those pages or features, search terms, the links on
			our Services that a User clicked on and other statistics. We use Log Data to provide and administer the Services
			and we analyze (and may engage third parties to analyze) Log Data to improve, customize and enhance our Services
			by expanding their features and functionality and tailoring them to our Users’ needs and preferences. We may use
			Log Data to generate aggregate, non-identifying information about how our Services are used.</span></p>

			some or all of our assets, including the information we have collected from you, may be disclosed or transferred
			to a third party acquirer in connection with the transaction.</span></p>

			Protection of Others</span><span class="s1">.We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials or
			private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We may disclose any information about you to government or

	<p class="p3"><span class="s1">5. Users Located in the European Economic Area. If you are a User located in the
			European Economic Area, you may have additional rights. Where you have consented to our processing of your

			their personal information, there may be circumstances in which we are unable to provide access, including but
			not limited to: where the information contains legal privilege, would compromise others’ privacy or other
			legitimate rights, where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the
			individual’s privacy in the case in question, where the request is manifestly unfounded or excessive, or where it
			is commercially proprietary. If we determine that access should be restricted in any particular instance, we will
			provide you with an explanation of why that determination has been made and a contact point for any further
