	<p class="p3"><span class="s1">(a) If you wish to access the Services, you must create a wallet with Company
			(“Wallet”) for that purpose. When you create a Wallet, you agree to take the following precautions, because
			failure to do so may result in loss of access to, and/or control over, your Wallet: (a) create a strong password
			that you do not use for any other website or online service; (b) provide accurate and truthful information; (c)
			maintain and promptly update your Wallet information; (d) maintain the security of your Wallet by protecting your
			Wallet password and access to your computer and your Wallet; (e) promptly notify us if you discover or otherwise
			suspect any security breaches related to your Wallet; and (f) use the backup functionality provided by the Wallet
			and safeguard your backup files as you would safeguard your most important personal information.</span></p>
	<p class="p3"><span class="s1">(b) When you create a Wallet, we will assign you an identifier that you must retain to
			access your Wallet.</span></p>
	<p class="p3"><span class="s1">(c) You hereby accept and acknowledge that you take responsibility for all activities
			that occur under your Wallet and accept all risks of any authorized or unauthorized access to your Wallet, to the
			maximum extent permitted by law.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

	<p class="p3"><span class="s1">(a) Wallet Address and Private Key and Backup Phrase. When you create a Wallet, the
			Services generate and store a cryptographic private and public key pair that you may use to send and receive any
			NASCoins via the relevant NASCoins network. The private key uniquely matches the Wallet address and must be used
			in connection with the Wallet address transfer NASCoins from that Wallet address. YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR
			MAINTAINING THE SECURITY OF YOUR PRIVATE KEY AND ANY BACKUP PHRASE ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR WALLET. YOU MUST KEEP
			YOUR WALLET ADDRESS, BACKUP PHRASE AND PRIVATE KEY ACCESS INFORMATION SECURE. FAILURE TO DO SO MAY RESULT IN THE
			LOSS OF CONTROL OF NASCOINS ASSOCIATED WITH THE WALLET.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
	<p class="p3"><span class="s1">(b) No Retrieval of Password or Private Keys. Company does not receive or store your
			Wallet password, backup phrase, or the unencrypted keys and addresses. Therefore, we cannot assist you with the
			retrieval of Wallet password or the keys or addresses. Our Services provide you with tools to help you remember
			or recover your password, including by allowing you to set password hints and use backup phrases, but the
			Services cannot generate a new password for your Wallet. You are solely responsible for remembering your Wallet
			password. If you have not safely stored a backup of any Wallet addresses and private key pairs maintained in your
			Wallet, you accept and acknowledge that any NASCoins you have associated with such Wallet addresses will become
			inaccessible if you do not have your Wallet password.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
	<p class="p3"><span class="s1">(c) Transactions. In order to be completed, all proposed NASCoins transactions must be
			confirmed and recorded in the NASCoins public ledger associated with the relevant NASCoins network. Such networks
			are decentralized, peer-to-peer networks supported by independent third-parties, which are not owned, controlled
			or operated by Company. Company has no control over any NASCoins network and therefore cannot and does not ensure
			that any transaction details you submit via the Services will be confirmed via the relevant NASCoins network. You
			acknowledge and agree that the transaction details you submit via the Services may not be completed, or may be
			substantially delayed, by the NASCoins network used to process the transaction and Company has no liability to
			you in this regard.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
	<p class="p3"><span class="s1">(d) No Storage or Transmission of NASCoins. A NASCoin is an intangible, digital asset.

			title that might occur in any NASCoins occurs on the decentralized ledger within the NASCoins network and not
			within the Service</span></p>

			provide via the Services is accurate and complete. You accept and acknowledge that Company is not responsible for
			any errors or omissions that you make in connection with any NASCoins transaction initiated via the Services, for
			instance, if you mistype a Wallet address or otherwise provide incorrect information. You agree to review your
			transaction details carefully before completing them via the Services.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
	<p class="p3"><span class="s1">(f) No Cancellations or Modifications. Once transaction details have been submitted to
			the NASCoins network via the Services, the Services cannot assist you to cancel or otherwise modify your
			transaction details. Company has no control over any NASCoins network and does not have the ability to facilitate
			any cancellation or modification requests.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

	<p class="p3"><span class="s1">a. If you are domiciled in and/or access, download and use our Services in the
			People’s Republic of China (the “PRC Residents”), the Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by
			and construed in accordance with laws of the People’s Republic of China.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
	<p class="p3"><span class="s1">b. For users of our Services who are not PRC Residents (the “Non-PRC Residents“),
			these Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the law of British Virgin Islands.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
	<p class="p3"><span class="s1">19. <b>Dispute Resolution</b>. Company believes that most disagreements can be
			resolved informally and efficiently by contacting Company’s customer support. If you are a Non-PRC Resident and
			the dispute is not resolved through Company customer support, you and Company agree that any such dispute, claim
			or controversy arising out of or relating in any way to the Services or this Agreement (each, a “Claim”), shall
			be determined by binding arbitration, instead of in courts of general jurisdiction, in accordance with the
			following (including the procedure to opt out of arbitration):<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
	<p class="p3"><span class="s1">a. Arbitration: Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses
			a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject
			to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. You
			agree that, you and Company are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.
			This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
	<p class="p3"><span class="s1">i. Opt-out. You may right to opt out of arbitration entirely and litigate any Claim if
			you provide us with written notice of your desire to do so by email at contact@nebulas.io within thirty (30) days
			following the date you first agree to these Terms.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
	<p class="p3"><span class="s1">ii. Notice of Claim: If you elect to seek arbitration, you must first send to Company,
			by certified mail, a written Notice of your Claim (“Notice of Claim”). The Notice of Claim to Company should be
			sent by email at contact@nebulas.io and should be prominently captioned “NOTICE OF CLAIM”. The Notice of Claim
			should include both the mailing address and email address you would like Company to use to contact you. If
			Company elects to seek arbitration, it will send, by certified mail, a written Notice of Claim to your billing
			address on file. A Notice of Claim, whether sent by you or by Company, must (a) describe the nature and basis of
			the claim or dispute; (b) set forth the specific amount of damages or other relief sought (“Demand”); and (c)
			whether you reject any subsequent modification of the Dispute Resolution section by Company (see Section
			19(a)(viii)).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
	<p class="p3"><span class="s1">iii. Arbitration Proceedings: If you and Company do not reach an agreement to resolve
			the claim within thirty (30) days after the Notice of Claim is received, you or Company may commence an
			arbitration proceeding. You may download or copy a form of notice and a form to initiate arbitration at
			www.adr.org. The arbitration will be governed by the Consumer or Commercial Arbitration Rules, as appropriate, of
			the CIETAC (collectively, the “CIETAC Rules“), as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the
			CIETAC. The CIETAC Rules and Forms are available online at www.adr.org. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of
			this Agreement. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope and
			enforceability of this arbitration provision.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
	<p class="p3"><span class="s1">iv. Unless Company and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place
			in China. If your claim is for U.S. $10,000 or less, Company agrees that you may choose whether the arbitration
			will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or
			by an in-person hearing as established by the CIETAC Rules. If your claim exceeds U.S. $10,000, the right to a
			hearing will be determined by the CIETAC Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted,
			the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and
			conclusions on which the award is based.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
	<p class="p3"><span class="s1">v. Injunctive and Declaratory Relief: The arbitrator shall determine all issues of
			liability on the merits of any claim asserted by you or Company, and may award declaratory or injunctive relief
			only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted
			by that party’s individual claim. To the extent that you or Company prevail on a claim and seek public injunctive
			relief (that is, injunctive relief that has the primary purpose and effect of prohibiting unlawful acts that
			threaten future injury to the general public), the entitlement to and extent of such relief must be litigated in
			a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. The parties agree that litigation of any issues
			of public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of the merits of any individual claims in
			arbitration.</span></p>
	<p class="p3"><span class="s1">vi. Class Action Waiver: YOU AND COMPANY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE
			OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR
			REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, if you have elected arbitration, unless both you and Company agree otherwise,
			the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside
			over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable,
			then the entirety of this Dispute Resolution section shall be null and void.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
	<p class="p3"><span class="s1">vii. Modification of Dispute Resolution Section: Notwithstanding Section 3, if Company
			changes this “Dispute Resolution for Non-PRC Residents“ section after the date you first accepted this Agreement,
			and you have not otherwise affirmatively agreed to such changes, you may reject any such change by so stating
			within your Notice of Claim. By failing to reject any changes to this “Dispute Resolution for Non-PRC Residents“
			section in your Notice of Claim, you agree to resolve any Claim between you and Company in accordance with the
			terms of the Dispute Resolution section in effect as of the date of your Notice of Claim.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
	<p class="p3"><span class="s1">viii. Severability: With the exception of any of the provisions in Section 19(a)(vii)
			of this Agreement (Class Action Waiver), if an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction decides that any
			part of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this Agreement shall still apply.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
	<p class="p3"><span class="s1">20. <b>General Terms</b>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
	<p class="p3"><span class="s1">a. Entire Agreement. These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and
			agreement between Company and you regarding the Services, and these Terms supersede and replace any and all prior
			oral or written understandings or agreements between Company and you regarding the Services. If any provision of

			provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain
			in full force and effect. You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without
			Company’s prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will
			be null. Company may freely assign or transfer these Terms without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these
			Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
	<p class="p3"><span class="s1">b. Notices. Any notices or other communications provided by Company under these Terms,
			including those regarding modifications to these Terms, will be given: (i)via email; or (ii)by posting to the
			Services. For notices made by e-mail, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is
			transmitted.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
	<p class="p3"><span class="s1">c. Waiver of Rights. Company’s failure to enforce any right or provision of these
			Terms will not be considered a waiver of such right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will
			be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Company. Except as expressly
			set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without
			prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
