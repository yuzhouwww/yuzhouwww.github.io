<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<em>Last Updated: [2018.7.16]</em>


<p><span>This Privacy Policy explains our practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of information that we receive through our Services. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any third-party websites, services or applications, even if they are accessible through our Services. Also, please note that, unless we define a term in this Privacy Policy, all capitalized terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms of Service. So, please make sure that you have read and understand our Terms of Service.
</span></p>


<p><span>1.<span>
</span></span><span>Revisions to this Privacy Policy. </span><span> Any information that is collected via our Services is covered by the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is collected. We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we'll notify you of those changes by posting them on the Services or by sending you an email or other notification, and we'll update the "Last Updated Date" above to indicate when those changes will become effective. You understand and agree that you will be deemed to have accepted the updated Privacy Policy if you use the Services after the updated Privacy Policy is posted on the Services.</span></p>

<p><span>2.<span>
</span></span><span>Information Collected or Received from You. </span><span>Our primary purposes for the collection and processing of information is to provide our Services (to perform our contract with you), to improve our Services, to administer your use of the Services, to market the Services to you, and to enable you to enjoy and easily navigate our Services. In addition we may process your information where we have a legitimate interest (e.g., fraud prevention, network and information security, research (including marketing research), and direct marketing), and as you otherwise consent.
(a)Information Collected Using Cookies and other Web Technologies.Like many online services, we may use automated data collection tools such as Cookies and Web Beacons to collect certain information. </span></p>

<p><span>(a)<span>
</span></span><u><span>Information Collected Using Cookies and other Web Technologies.</span></u>Like many online services, we may use automated data collection tools such as Cookies and Web Beacons to collect certain information.</span></p>

<p><span><b>Cookies</b>
to identify that you've logged in to the Services and to tell us how and when you interact with our Services. We may also use Cookies to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on our Services and to customize and improve our Services. Unlike persistent Cookies, session Cookies are deleted when you log off from the Services and close your browser. Although most browsers automatically accept Cookies, you can change your browser options to stop automatically accepting Cookies or to prompt you before accepting Cookies. Please note, however, that if you don't accept Cookies, you may not be able to access all portions or features of the Services. Some third-party service providers that we engage (including third-party advertisers) may also place their own Cookies on your device. This practice is commonly referred to as "interest-based advertising" or "online behavioral advertising." If you would like to opt out of the cookies we employ on the Services, you may do so by blocking, deleting or disabling them as your browser or device permits. Note that this Privacy Policy covers only our use of Cookies and does not include use of Cookies by such third parties.</span></p>

<p><span><b>Web Beacons</b>
(also known as web bugs, pixel tags or clear GIFs) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier that may be included on our Services for several purposes, including to deliver or communicate with Cookies, to track and measure the performance of our Services, to monitor how many visitors view our Services, and to monitor the effectiveness of our advertising. Unlike Cookies, which are stored on the device, Web Beacons are typically embedded invisibly on web pages (or in an e-mail).</span></p>

<p><span><b>Log Data</b>
means certain information about how a person uses our Services (each, a "User"). Log Data may include information such as a User's Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, operating system, the web page that a User was visiting before accessing our Services, the pages or features of our Services to which a User browsed and the time spent on those pages or features, search terms, the links on our Services that a User clicked on and other statistics. We use Log Data to provide and administer the Services and we analyze (and may engage third parties to analyze) Log Data to improve, customize and enhance our Services by expanding their features and functionality and tailoring them to our Users' needs and preferences. We may use Log Data to generate aggregate, non-identifying information about how our Services are used.</span></p>

<h1>Terms of Service</h1>

<em>Last Updated: [2018.7.16]</em>


<p><span>Please read Nebulas IO Limited's ("Company", "we", "us" or "our") Terms of Service (the "Terms") and the Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") carefully because they govern your use of our mobile device application for the receipt and transfer of NASCoins ("App"). These Terms constitute a binding obligation between you and Company. To make these Terms easier to read, our services and App are collectively called the "Services." "NASCoins" means the native unit of value on the Nebulas protocol, which refers to the blockchain protocol initiated by the Nebulas Foundation.
</span></p>


<p><span>1.<span>
<strong>Agreement to Terms.</strong> By using our Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you don't agree to be bound by these Terms, do not use the Services. If you are accessing and using the Services on behalf of a company (such as your employer) or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that company or other legal entity to these Terms. In that case, "you" and "your" will refer to that company or other legal entity.
</p>

<p><span>2.<span>
<strong>Privacy Policy.</strong> Please refer to our Privacy Policy for information on how we collect, use and disclose information from our users. You acknowledge and agree that your use of the Services is subject to our Privacy Policy.
</p>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTICE REGARDING ARBITRATION: FOR RESIDENTS OUTSIDE OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA, WHEN YOU AGREE TO THESE TERMS YOU ARE AGREEING (WITH LIMITED EXCEPTION) TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND COMPANY THROUGH BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT. PLEASE REVIEW CAREFULLY SECTION 18 "DISPUTE RESOLUTION FOR NON-PRC RESIDENTS" BELOW FOR DETAILS REGARDING ARBITRATION (INCLUDING THE PROCEDURE TO OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION).
</strong></p>

<p><span>3.</span> <strong>Changes to Terms or Services.</strong> We may update the Terms at any time, in our sole discretion. If we do so, we'll deliver a notice either by posting the updated Terms on the App or through other communications. It's important that you review the Terms whenever we update them or you use the Services. If you continue to use the Services after we have posted updated Terms, you are agreeing to be bound by the updated Terms. If you don't agree to be bound by the updated Terms, then, except as otherwise provided in Section 18(a)(viii) ("Modification of Dispute Resolution Section"), you may not use the Services anymore. Because our Services are evolving over time we may change or discontinue all or any part of the Services, at any time and without notice, at our sole discretion.
</p>


<p><span>4.</span> <strong>Who May Use the Services?</strong> You may use the Services only if you are 13 years or older and are not barred from using the Services under applicable law. If you are between 13 and 18, you must have permission from your legal guardian before you are permitted to use the Services.
</p>


<p><span>5.</span><strong>Wallet Registration. </strong></p>
<p>(a)	 If you wish to access the Services, you must create a wallet with Company ("Wallet") for that purpose. When you create a Wallet, you agree to take the following precautions, because failure to do so may result in loss of access to, and/or control over, your Wallet: (a) create a strong password that you do not use for any other website or online service; (b) provide accurate and truthful information; (c) maintain and promptly update your Wallet information; (d) maintain the security of your Wallet by protecting your Wallet password and access to your computer and your Wallet; (e) promptly notify us if  you discover or otherwise suspect any security breaches related to your Wallet; and (f) use the backup functionality provided by the Wallet and safeguard your backup files as you would safeguard your most important personal information.</p>
<p>(b)	When you create a Wallet, we will assign you an identifier that you must retain to access your Wallet.</p>
<p>(c)	You hereby accept and acknowledge that you take responsibility for all activities that occur under your Wallet and accept all risks of any authorized or unauthorized access to your Wallet, to the maximum extent permitted by law.
</p>


<p>6.<strong>Wallet Services. </strong></p>
<p>
(a)	Wallet Address and Private Key and Backup Phrase. When you create a Wallet, the Services generate and store a cryptographic private and public key pair that you may use to send and receive any NASCoins via the relevant NASCoins network. The private key uniquely matches the Wallet address and must be used in connection with the Wallet address transfer NASCoins from that Wallet address. YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING THE SECURITY OF YOUR PRIVATE KEY AND ANY BACKUP PHRASE ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR WALLET. YOU MUST KEEP YOUR WALLET ADDRESS, BACKUP PHRASE AND PRIVATE KEY ACCESS INFORMATION SECURE. FAILURE TO DO SO MAY RESULT IN THE LOSS OF CONTROL OF NASCOINS ASSOCIATED WITH THE WALLET. 
</p>

<p>(b)	No Retrieval of Password or Private Keys. Company does not receive or store your Wallet password, backup phrase, or the unencrypted keys and addresses. Therefore, we cannot assist you with the retrieval of Wallet password or the keys or addresses. Our Services provide you with tools to help you remember or recover your password, including by allowing you to set password hints and use backup phrases, but the Services cannot generate a new password for your Wallet. You are solely responsible for remembering your Wallet password. If you have not safely stored a backup of any Wallet addresses and private key pairs maintained in your Wallet, you accept and acknowledge that any NASCoins you have associated with such Wallet addresses will become inaccessible if you do not have your Wallet password.
</p>

<p>(c)	Transactions. In order to be completed, all proposed NASCoins transactions must be confirmed and recorded in the NASCoins public ledger associated with the relevant NASCoins network. Such networks are decentralized, peer-to-peer networks supported by independent third-parties, which are not owned, controlled or operated by Company. Company has no control over any NASCoins network and therefore cannot and does not ensure that any transaction details you submit via the Services will be confirmed via the relevant NASCoins network. You acknowledge and agree that the transaction details you submit via the Services may not be completed, or may be substantially delayed, by the NASCoins network used to process the transaction and Company has no liability to you in this regard.
</p>

<p>(d)	No Storage or Transmission of NASCoins. A NASCoin is an intangible, digital asset. They exist only by virtue of the ownership record maintained in the underlying NASCoins network. Any transfer of title that might occur in any NASCoins occurs on the decentralized ledger within the NASCoins network and not within the Service</p>

<p>(e)	Accuracy of Information. You represent and warrant that any information you provide via the Services is accurate and complete. You accept and acknowledge that Company is not responsible for any errors or omissions that you make in connection with any NASCoins transaction initiated via the Services, for instance, if you mistype a Wallet address or otherwise provide incorrect information. You agree to review your transaction details carefully before completing them via the Services.
</p>

<p>(f)	No Cancellations or Modifications. Once transaction details have been submitted to the NASCoins network via the Services, the Services cannot assist you to cancel or otherwise modify your transaction details. Company has no control over any NASCoins network and does not have the ability to facilitate any cancellation or modification requests.
</p>

<p>(g)	Taxes. It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the transactions you for which you have submitted transaction details via the Services, and it is your responsibility to report and remit the correct tax to the appropriate tax authority. You agree that Company is not responsible for determining whether taxes apply to your NASCoins transactions or for collecting, reporting, withholding or remitting any taxes arising from any NASCoins transactions.
</p>

<p>7.<strong>Wallet Fees. </strong></p>

<p class="children">(a)	Creation of a Wallet. Creating a Wallet is free. Company does not currently charge fees for any Services, however we reserve the right to do so in future, and in such case any applicable fees will be displayed prior to you using any Service to which a fee applies</p>

<p class="children">(b)	Validation Fees. A NASCoins network is a network of computers operated by individuals or entities who voluntarily participate in the process of validating transactions on the network.  You agree to pay any validation fees that apply with respect to a transfer of your NASCoins.
</p>

<p class="children">(c)	No Ability to Cancel. You will not be able to change your mind once you have confirmed that you wish to proceed with a transaction.</p>

18. <strong>Governing Law and Forum Choice. </strong>
</p>

<p class="children">
a.	If you are domiciled in and/or access, download and use our Services in the People's Republic of China (the "PRC Residents"), the Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by and construed in accordance with laws of the People's Republic of China. 
</p>

<p class="children">
b.	For users of our Services who are not PRC Residents (the "Non-PRC Residents"), these Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, federal arbitration law, and the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in Section 13, "Dispute Resolution for Non-PRC Residents," for Non-PRC Residents, the exclusive jurisdiction for all Disputes (defined below) that you and Company are not required to arbitrate will be the state and federal courts located in the Northern District of California, and you and Company each waive any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts.
</p>


<p>
19. <strong>Dispute Resolution for Non-PRC Residents</strong>. Company believes that most disagreements can be resolved informally and efficiently by contacting Company's customer support.  If you are a Non-PRC Resident and the dispute is not resolved through Company customer support, you and Company agree that any such dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating in any way to the Services or this Agreement (each, a "Claim"), shall be determined by binding arbitration or small claims court, instead of in courts of general jurisdiction, in accordance with the following (including the procedure to opt out of arbitration): 
</p>
<p class="children">
a.	Arbitration:  Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts.  Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. You agree that, by agreeing to these Terms, the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration provision, and that you and Company are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms. 
</p>

<p class="list">
i.	Opt-out. You may right to opt out of arbitration entirely and litigate any Claim if you provide us with written notice of your desire to do so by email at contact@nebulas.io within thirty (30) days following the date you first agree to these Terms.
</p>

<p class="list">
ii.	Notice of Claim:  If you elect to seek arbitration, you must first send to Company, by certified mail, a written Notice of your Claim ("Notice of Claim"). The Notice of Claim to Company should be sent by email at contact@nebulas.io and should be prominently captioned "NOTICE OF CLAIM".  The Notice of Claim should include both the mailing address and email address you would like Company to use to contact you.  If Company elects to seek arbitration, it will send, by certified mail, a written Notice of Claim to your billing address on file.  A Notice of Claim, whether sent by you or by Company, must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; (b) set forth the specific amount of damages or other relief sought ("Demand"); and (c) whether you reject any subsequent modification of the Dispute Resolution section by Company (see Section 13(a)(viii)). 
</p>

<p class="list">
iii.	Arbitration Proceedings:  If you and Company do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after the Notice of Claim is received, you or Company may commence an arbitration proceeding (or, alternatively, file a claim in small claims court). You may download or copy a form of notice and a form to initiate arbitration at www.adr.org. The arbitration will be governed by the Consumer or Commercial Arbitration Rules, as appropriate, of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") (collectively, the "AAA Rules"), as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and Forms are available online at www.adr.org. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision. 
</p>

<p class="list">
iv.	Unless Company and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of either your residence or of the mailing address you provided in your Notice of Claim. If your claim is for U.S. $10,000 or less, Company agrees that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds U.S. $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. 
</p>

<p class="list">
v.	Injunctive and Declaratory Relief:  Except as set forth in Section 18(b), the arbitrator shall determine all issues of liability on the merits of any claim asserted by you or Company, and may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.  To the extent that you or Company prevail on a claim and seek public injunctive relief (that is, injunctive relief that has the primary purpose and effect of prohibiting unlawful acts that threaten future injury to the general public), the entitlement to and extent of such relief must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration.  The parties agree that litigation of any issues of public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of the merits of any individual claims in arbitration.
</p>

<p class="list">
vi.	Arbitration Fees:  If your claim for damages does not exceed $10,000, Company will pay all fees imposed by the AAA to conduct the arbitration, including reimbursement of your initial filing fee, unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). If your claim for damages exceeds $10,000, standard AAA Rules will govern the payment of all AAA fees, including filing, administration and arbitrator fees.
</p>

<p class="list">   
vii.	Class Action Waiver:  YOU AND COMPANY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, if you have elected arbitration, unless both you and Company agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Dispute Resolution section shall be null and void.
</p>

<p class="list">
viii.	Modification of Dispute Resolution Section: Notwithstanding Section 3, if Company changes this "Dispute Resolution for Non-PRC Residents" section after the date you first accepted this Agreement, and you have not otherwise affirmatively agreed to such changes, you may reject any such change by so stating within your Notice of Claim.  By failing to reject any changes to this "Dispute Resolution for Non-PRC Residents" section in your Notice of Claim, you agree to resolve any Claim between you and Company in accordance with the terms of the Dispute Resolution section in effect as of the date of your Notice of Claim
</p>

<p class="list">
ix.	Severability: With the exception of any of the provisions in Section 13(a)(vii) of this Agreement (Class Action Waiver), if an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction decides that any part of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this Agreement shall still apply. 
</p>

<p class="children">
b.Small Claims Court: Notwithstanding Section 18(a), you may elect to litigate your Claim in small claims court if all the requirements of the small claims court are satisfied, including any limitations on jurisdiction and the amount at issue in the dispute.  You agree to bring a Claim in small claims court in your county of residence. 

</p>

<p>
20. <strong>General Terms</strong>.
</p>

<p class="children">
a. Entire Agreement.

</p>

<p class="children">
